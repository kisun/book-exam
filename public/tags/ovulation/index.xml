      <description>Regulation of ovulation rate in mmamals: contribution of sheep genetic models It has long been suggested and proved that ovulation rate in sheep can be modulated or regulated by single genes known as fecundity genes. This review explores the role of three major fecundity genes (GDF9, BMP15 and BMPR1B). These genes are part of Bone Morphogenic Protein (BMP) system. Identification and characterization of several alleles of these candidate genes and associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are reviewed in the first section of the paper.</description>
