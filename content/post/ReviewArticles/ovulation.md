## Regulation of ovulation rate in mmamals: contribution of sheep genetic models
It has long been suggested and proved that ovulation rate in sheep can be modulated or regulated by single genes known as fecundity genes. This review explores the role of three major fecundity genes (GDF9, BMP15 and BMPR1B). These genes are part of Bone Morphogenic Protein (BMP) system. Identification and characterization of several alleles of these candidate genes and associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are reviewed in the first section of the paper. Seven mutations (five in BMP15 and one each in GDF9 and BMPR1B) were reported to have functional significance in ovulation rate in different sheep breeds. In the later part of the paper, authors reviewed mechanistic roles of these major genes and proposed a model/hypothesis. The mutations in the major genes reduces the overall BMP system which leads to increased ovulation. Mutations in Fec genes are assumed to involved already during the early folliculogenes likely by imparing the the proliferative actions of BMP system. Such activity together with relevant hormones and other factors lead to ovulation of smaller follicles instead of larger single follicle. To sum up, the lower the activity in BMP system, the higher the ovulation rate.

**Short remark**: There are now additional genes and regions (eg. B4GALNT2, FecL locus) associated with hyperprolificay or infertility. It would be more interesting to get crystal structures of these major genes and perform functional characterization. There exist one study where authors perform homology based modeling of GDF9 and BMP15 structure using pig TGFB1 (PDF 3RJR) which has about 20% sequence identity.
